I finished files 1-13.
Did not get to array sort, etc. 
I believe that functionally, much of my code works, 
but I just did not have enough time to implement 
the functions to make arraysort. 
I had one issue in getting user input. 
I could not increment inputcount properly, 
thus I could never reach the correct part of arraysort.
I also could not scan lines such as (2 (label))
, so my program crashes when it reaches labels 
such as "done" which have no statements attached to it.
Thank you for taking the time to read this.
