ASG4 - Prolog Flight
README

Writing recursion in prolog was very confusing for me. I also could not get test5 file to print out the error message I wanted.
However, Professor Mackey said that any output for that was ok. It was hard to check manually whether a flight was possible in
24 hours or not. I kind of just had to hope that my algorithm was correct. It was hard to come up with an algorithm, but
graphpaths.pl from the Examples helped a lot. At first, my algorithm was finding the wrong connecting flights. 
But then I realized I needed to pass the wanted departure time of the connecting flight into the argument. Google said the
radius of the Earth is 3959, but haversine.perl used 3961, so i decided to use 3961.
